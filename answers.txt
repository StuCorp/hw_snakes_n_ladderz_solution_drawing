What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?
- so many. 
* we thought about using key-value pairs for snake positions
* the separate viewer
* in the solution SnakesAndLadders initialises all the class instances and then Game runs the logic of the game - those functions were not separate for us
* the user i/o was also not separated (Viewer class) in ours; rather just strung throughout

Are there any parts you don't understand?
* i was finding  it hard to follow the labyrinth of functions in Game, starting with next turn(), but i think i get it now. 

Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
* can't test, that is predict, the output of a psuedo-randomiser function, unless you are Sam DaBell.

Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
*keeps it clean
*works with a log file; designed to fit it
